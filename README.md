# RepoSize
A command line tool that returns the size of a specified repo.

The main reason I am creating this tool is due to the fact that I realized it's fairly opaque finding out the size of a repo. 

This can be important in data constrained environments (like a case in which a user has a data use limit) and needs to pull a repository. Finding out the size of repository can save costs before pulling a repo.
